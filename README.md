# RESTORE

This github repo is linked to the 4th-year research project entitled "Identifying the impact of fascia on cutaneous adipocytes" at INSA Toulouse, under the supervision of Pierre Weiss from the GMM department, as well as Audrey Varin and Corinne Barreau from the RESTORE laboratory

Note that this repo only contains the jupyter notebooks used for the statistical analysis of our results, as most of the project has been done under the dedicated programs Fiji and Ilastik. Furthermore, the images used weighting 30 GB each, and the crops still weighting 1 GB, the data files are not available on this repo and should be accessed separately because of their size.
